Thera Bank is aiming to grow its base of *asset customers* (i.e., borrowers) since most of its current customers are *liability customers* (depositors). The bank earns more through interest on loans, so it wants to convert depositors into personal loan takers. A previous marketing campaign had a 9% conversion rate, which has encouraged further targeted efforts to increase loan adoption with minimal costs.

### 🧠 About the Project: Thera Bank Personal Loan Dataset
📦 Dataset:
Imported from Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling/data

### 🎯 Aims of the Project:

In this project I acted as the data analyst for the Thera Bank company. My goal was to:
* Help the bank identify which customers are more likely to accept a personal loan.

* Use this to make marketing more targeted and cost-effective. 

 Show how a company is growing (or struggling) with its recurring revenue, churn, and customer retention, using clean visuals and actionable insights.
Help the bank identify which customers are more likely to accept a personal loan.

Use this to make marketing more targeted and cost-effective
 
#### **Business Goal:**

* Build a **predictive model** to identify which liability customers are most likely to accept a **personal loan**.
* This model will help improve the **success rate of marketing campaigns** while **reducing overall costs**.

The main goal of this dataset is to:

Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.

Help the bank target the right customers in future marketing campaigns, to save money and increase success rates.

This is a classification problem because the target variable (whether a customer accepted a personal loan) is binary (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
